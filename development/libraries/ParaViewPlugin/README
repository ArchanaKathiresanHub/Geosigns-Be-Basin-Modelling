The ParaView plugin is not built by default. To build it, your build has to
configured a bit differently.  Concretely, run the following command from your
build directory:
$srcdir/bootstrap.csh -DBM_BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN=ON && make ParaViewReader
where you should substitute $srcdir with the path to your source directory.

This will create the libParaViewReader.so file in the subdir
libraries/ParaViewReader of your build directory. To use the plugin, go to menu
Tools->Manage Plugins... Load the libParaViewReader.so file with 'Load New...'
After closing that dialog, open a .project3d file via the File menu and click
Apply to apply the changes in the VTK pipeline.
