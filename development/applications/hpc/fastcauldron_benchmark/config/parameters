# Lines beginning with a # are comments
# 
# General syntax is
#   Name: Section - Name - Parameter
#
# The Name is an identifier with which you can refer to it.
# 
# Section can be
#  - 'Project3D' for parameters in the .project3d files
#  - 'CauldronCmdLine' for parameters that are given on the command line when starting fastcauldron
#  - 'MpiCmdLine' for parameters that are given to mpiexec
#  - 'LsfCmdLine' for parameters that arg given to LSF bsub
#  - 'Build' for information how the fastcauldron executable was build
#
# The syntax for Project3D parameters is
#   Table.Field:Type.RecordNr
# or
#   Table.Field:Type.[ Field:Type = Value ] 
#
# The syntax for CmdLine parameters is
#   option,option,...
#
# The former form states explicitly from which record to extract the field from,
# the latter refers to the first record for which the condition between the brackets is true, holds.
# That can be useful when that field has only unique values
