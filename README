Usage instructions
------------------

After building the applications you can run them from the build directory. Just
source the generated 'envsetup.sh' script in your environment and you can run
any application:

   Fastcauldron
     
      The produced binary is applications/fastcauldron/fastcauldron. This is an
      MPI program and it takes a bunch of parameters, of which the most notable
      are:

        -project FILENAME    [required] Sets the filename of the project to
                             simulate.
         
        -save FILENAME       [optional] Without this parameter the simulator
                             writes its results to the input project file. When
                             this parameter is also given, it will leave the
                             original project file untouched and write the
                             result to the file denoted by this parameter.

        -itcoupled           [required] Set simulation mode to fully coupled
                             pressure and temperature calculation. There are
                             other simulation modes, but they should only be
                             used by an expert. 

        -help                [optional] Prints a list of (most) command line
                             parameters

      For the people who are interested in performance analysis, the following
      options might be useful:
        
        -verbose             [optional] Generates lots of diagnostic
                             information how the simulator and its
                             sub-components are performing. For example, you
                             will get iteration count of the linear solver,
                             iteration counts of the non-linear solver, wall
                             clock times, etc... 

        -log_summary         [optional] Prints detailed information about
                             performance of PETSc solvers.

        -nohdfoutput         [optional] Disables writing of HDF5 results to
                             disk. Since I/O is a big bottleneck, it is
                             necessary to disable it when doing analysis of
                             CPU and RAM performance.
