lock.c was copied over from /nfs/rvl/groups/ept-sg/SWEast/Cauldron/hpc/mpich2-1.4.1p1/src/mpi/romio/adio/common.
The functions in lock.c (ADIOI_setlock) overrule the functions with the same name in the intel mpi library.
lock.o must be linked in directly (do not use the library),
as we require the functions of lock.o to be present [in the executable] before they are actually required and linking in the library won't do this!
