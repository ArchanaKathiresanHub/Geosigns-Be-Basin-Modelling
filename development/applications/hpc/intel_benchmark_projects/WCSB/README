The generate.sh script in this directory will create 4 x 4 = 16 projects from
one original template. The original project is the WCSB model.
Then there are four sizes: 
  - Medium, which is a subsampling of this project by 3x3, 
  - Large, which is this project at full resolution,
  - Dream, which is this project super-sampled 3x3, and
  - Impossible, which is this project super-sampled 17x17.

There are 4 difficulty levels. This difficulty level reflects the amount of
errort the solver needs:
  - Easy. All layers are parallel, level, and made out of standard sandstone.
  - Medium. The geometry of the basin is the same as the original, but all
    formations are made out of sandstone.
  - Hard. The stratigraphy of the basin is the same as the original
  - Salt. The original stratigraphy but with some formations set to consist of
    pure impermeable salt.

The resulting 16 projects are all combinations of sizes and difficulties.
