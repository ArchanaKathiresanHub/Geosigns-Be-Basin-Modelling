The generate.sh script in this directory will create 2 x 4 = 8 projects from
one original template. The original project is the Barrowlands training model.
Then there are two sizes: 
  - Micro, which is a subsampling of this project by 10x10, and
  - Small, which is this project at full resolution

There are 4 difficulty levels. This difficulty level reflects the amount of
errort the solver needs:
  - Easy. All layers are parallel, level, and made out of standard sandstone.
  - Medium. The geometry of the basin is the same as the original, but all
    formations are made out of sandstone.
  - Hard. The stratigraphy of the basin is the same as the original
  - Salt. The original stratigraphy but with some formations set to consist of
    pure impermeable salt.

The resulting 8 projects are all combinations of sizes and difficulties.
